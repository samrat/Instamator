If you want to experiment with Instamator's code instead, you're in the right place. To begin:

- Go to http://instagram.com/developer and register your app. You'll get a client_id and client_secret.
- Replace those values in app.py(line# 22)
- Setup Redis(http://redis.io)
- You're ready to go now- just run `python app.py` from your command line and you'll find your app running on http://localhost:5000/
